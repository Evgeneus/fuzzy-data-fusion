Hercules was the powerful son of the god king Zeus. For this, he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labors, and the death of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years, he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting, and the presence of death. These men and women never question where they go to fight, or why, or whom, just how much they will be paid.

The Jewish family discover that their son (Joseph) has a blood group type different from his parents, so his father (Alon) can think of only two explanations: either his wife (Orith) has cheated on him, or the boy is not their son. Meanwhile a family doctor made a research and found that in that year when Orith had delivered her baby 18 years ago a raid hit that hospital, and in the panic of trying to escape and save the infants, the babies were switched by mistake. The problem is that the other baby lives on the other side of the wall, a Muslim from a Palestine family.

When he discovers that an ex-girlfriend is living with his dad, he gets drunk, calls every woman in his cell phone contact list, and ends up passed out naked in her living room. By this time, she's a medical resident in L.A. and he's a gopher on a ""Glee""-like TV series, hoping to be a writer. She guards her emotions (calling her father's funeral ""a thing""), so after a quick shag in the moments she has before leaving for the hospital, she asks if he wants a no-strings-attached, sex-only relationship, without romance or complications.
